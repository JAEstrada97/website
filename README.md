website for 322

api used was a movie database named http://omdbapi.com/

images were found via google and/or pulled from the OMDb database.

Header and footer code was used from bootstrap templates (including a jquery function
found in /js/scripts). taking advantage of 
responsive header (collapsable on mobile). also, the web pages were built with 
bootstraps grid system.

index.html servers as the 'about' page, and the 4 requires pages are for each movie.
Every movie pages is built from an ajax call at the bottom of the page and all
data is attributed using jquery (see ID tags for movie title, plot, and poster image)

basic css used for coloring and for centering.

github pages sometimes takes a while to load the ajax call, but they all work.

thank you!
